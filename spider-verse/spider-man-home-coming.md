Amazing art by Romita Jr.
Spider dealing with MJ break up and moving to a new place.
He help a nerd against bullies, since when he doesn't know that's not how its done? Maybe that's the sympthom of him not being himself anymore.
What happened in the first 29 issues?
New character appears, Ezekiel, jumping fast just like the spider. Is he a spider from another universe?
Who is the German hero that dies eaten in the end of the chapter? Is that Darlum guy a soul eater, vampire or something? Does he feeds from people's natural energy?
Reminds me of Dragon Ball Super's Moro arch.
